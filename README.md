# Micro Blog

A minimal markdown-to-HTML blog generator that happens to work.

## Philosophy & Constraints

This project explores the **minimum** needed for a static site generator. It's an exercise in simplicity.

### Core Principles

**What We Optimize For:**
- Minimal dependencies
- Good DX
- Keep it small and readable
- Simple mental model (.md > .html)

**What We Explicitly Don't Care About:**
- Edge case handling
- Production-grade error recovery
- Perfect developer ergonomics
- Enterprise features

### Rules to Stay Minimal

1. **Avoid new dependencies**
2. **No defensive programming** - let it fail visibly when misconfigured
3. **No features "for later"** - solve real problems, not hypothetical ones
4. **Prefer simple over clever** - avoid abstractions until pain is clear
5. **Document assumptions** instead of handling edge cases

**Bloat detection:** If the codebase grows beyond ~300 lines of actual code (`npm run loc`), something went wrong.

This isn't a framework. It's a learning tool that happens to work.

## Features

- ✓ Converts markdown files to HTML
- ✓ Dev server with live reload
- ✓ Only 1 npm dependency (`marked`) so far
- ✓ Built with Node.js built-ins

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependency
npm install

# Build static HTML files
npm run build

# Run dev server with live reload
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

```

## Usage

### Writing Posts

1. Create a `.md` file in the `content/` folder
2. Run `npm run build` or `npm run dev`
3. Find your HTML in `dist/`

### Development

The dev server watches for changes in `content/` and automatically rebuilds.

### Production

Run `npm run build` to generate HTML files, then deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host.

## How It Works

**template.html**:
- HTML template with `{{title}}` and `{{content}}` placeholders
- Includes basic styling for clean typography

**lib/builder.js** (~130 lines):
- Async build logic with parallel file processing

**scripts/server.js** (~95 lines):
- Dev server with file watching and Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Watches `content/` and rebuilds only the changed file
- SSE endpoint at `/events` pushes reload notifications to browser
- EventEmitter broadcasts to all connected browser tabs
- Serves files from `dist/` via HTTP

**scripts/live-reload.js** (~10 lines):
- Client-side script using EventSource API
- Connects to `/events` endpoint for real-time updates
- Automatically reloads page when server pushes 'reload' event
