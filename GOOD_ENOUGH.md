# Reef 1.0 Definition

## Core functionality:

✅ Static HTML pages
✅ Markdown support
✅ JSX pages support
✅ Islands architecture (Solid/Preact components)
✅ Plugin system (functional, documented)
✅ Bun runtime migration

## Must-have plugins

Syntax highlighting?
RSS feed generation?
Sitemap?
Image optimization?

## Documentation:
Reef's own docs site built with Reef (dogfooding)
Uses JSX + Islands to demonstrate capabilities
Shows plugin examples
Clear "getting started" guide

## Code quality:
Core logic has tests (not 100%, but critical paths covered)
Self-documenting code (good naming, types, comments where needed)
Minimal, intentional codebase
Clear file structure

## Version boundary:
Once these are done → call it 1.0, ship it, move on. If people ask for features later, that's 2.0 territory.
