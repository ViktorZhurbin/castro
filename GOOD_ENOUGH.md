# Reef 1.0 Definition

## Core functionality:

✅ Static HTML pages
✅ Markdown support
✅ JSX pages support
✅ Islands architecture (Solid/Preact components)
✅ Plugin system (functional, documented)

## Must-have plugins

Syntax highlighting?

## Documentation:
- [ ] Reef's own docs site built with Reef (dogfooding)
- [ ] Uses JSX + Islands to demonstrate capabilities
- [ ] Shows plugin examples
- [ ] Clear "getting started" guide

## Code quality:
- [ ] Core logic has tests (not 100%, but critical paths covered)
- [x] Self-documenting code (good naming, types, comments where needed)

## Version boundary:
Once these are done → call it 1.0, ship it, move on. If people ask for features later, that's 2.0 territory.
