# Potential Niche
**"Lightweight islands framework for static HTML"**

## Value Prop
* **Start with static HTML/markdown**
* **Add Solid/Preact islands where needed**
* **No hydration overhead** (web components self-hydrate)
* **Minimal, understandable codebase**

## Comparable To:
* **Lighter than Astro:** Focused; not trying to be everything.
* **More structured than vanilla is-land:** Better developer ergonomics.
* **Framework-agnostic like Astro but simpler.**

## Realistic Market Size
* Educational/documentation sites.
* Personal blogs wanting occasional interactivity.
* Developers who find Astro too complex.
* Teams wanting islands without framework lock-in.

## Likely Outcome
* 100-500 stars if you ship it well and promote it.
* Small but appreciative community.
* Good portfolio piece.
* Unlikely to replace Astro/Next.

### Better outcome if:
* You target a specific niche (e.g., "perfect for technical documentation").
* Create excellent docs using Reef itself.
* Write compelling "why Reef" content.
* Engage in relevant communities (dev.to, Reddit, Discord).

## My Recommendation
**Given your situation:**

1. **Finish Reef 1.0 as planned:** (JSX, islands, docs site).
2. **Position it clearly:** "Lightweight islands framework" not "SSG".
3. **Write the learning blog post:** "Building an islands framework taught me X".
4. **Ship it and move on:** Don't chase stars, extract the learning.
5. **Use it for real projects:** Your portfolio, calendar prototype.
