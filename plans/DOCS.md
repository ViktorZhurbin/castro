## Documentation Site

### Create Docs Site Structure
**Goal:** Documentation site built with Castro itself (dogfooding)

**Required pages:**

**The Manifesto (Introduction)**
   - What is island architecture (serious)
   - Why it matters for performance (serious)
   - How Castro implements it (serious)
   - Why we made it funny (meta/honest)

**The Codebase Tour**
   - Annotated walkthrough of the source
   - "This is the parser, here's how it works..."
   - "This is hydration, here's the technique..."
   - Learn by reading, not guessing

**About Page**
   - "From each component according to its complexity, to each page according to its needs."
   - Explain it's educational, satire is wrapper
   - Zero-config, maximum-discipline philosophy

**Success criteria:**
- Site is built using Castro
- All pages render correctly
- Navigation works
- Demonstrates framework capabilities

## Polish & Launch

Review README and update as needed, after all the changes above.

## Quality Gates

Before moving to next phase, verify:

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Can someone learn from this code right now?
- ✅ Are comments educational, not just descriptive?
- ✅ Is codebase under 1500 LOC (excluding comments)?

**Satire Balance:**
- ✅ Does satire enhance or distract from learning?
- ✅ Are errors still helpful despite jokes?
- ✅ Would you show this to a senior dev without embarrassment?

**Educational Value:**
- ✅ Does it actually teach islands architecture?
- ✅ Can someone read it and understand the concepts?
- ✅ Are examples clear and practical?

## Critical Principles

**Remember:**
1. **Code is serious, wrapper is funny** - Never sacrifice clarity for jokes
2. **Education first** - Satire makes it memorable, education makes it valuable
3. **Keep it simple** - <1500 LOC is a feature, not a limitation
4. **Comment generously** - Every function teaches something
5. **Dogfood it** - Docs site must be built with Castro
6. **Ship and iterate** - Launch with minimum viable content, expand based on feedback

## Puns & Slogans (For Marketing)

Use these in docs/marketing:

- "No component hoards JS unless it is socially necessary"
- "Workers of the web, unite!"
- "The performance is... mandatory"
- "Bundle sizes will be redistributed equally"
- "The people's framework. Bundle sizes will be redistributed equally. ✊"
- "Redistribute interactivity to the components that need it most."
- "Seize the means of rendering"
- "Your 5-year plan to understand islands architecture"
- "Coming to npm after the revolution 🚩"

## What Success Looks Like

**Launch state:**
- Codebase is educational-ready (<1500 LOC + comments)
- CLI works with themed output
- 3 directives implemented and documented
- Docs site exists with at least one tutorial
- README sells the concept
