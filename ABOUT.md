# Castro Framework - Development Instructions

## Project Overview

Castro is a satirical educational Static Site Generator that teaches island architecture through ~1500 lines of well-commented, self-explanatory code. Built on the existing Reef codebase, it wraps serious technical implementation in communist-themed presentation.

**Core Philosophy:**
- Code is serious, clean, and educational
- Satire is in presentation layer only (CLI, errors, docs, naming)
- Educational value takes priority over jokes
- Try to keep actual codebase slim (currently <1500 LOC) + add explanatory comments generously to make sure every bit is clear to those who want to understand islands architecture

## What We're Building

### Educational Core
- Working SSG with island architecture
- Selective hydration (only interactive components get JS)
- SSR/SSG with build-time rendering
- Simple, readable codebase that teaches by example
- Every file has explanatory comments showing "why" not just "what"

### Communist Wrapper (Satire Layer)
- CLI with themed output ("Consulting Central Committee...")
- Error messages from "The Ministry of Errors"
- Config file: `manifesto.js`
- Hydration directives: `no:pasaran`, `lenin:awake`, `comrade:visible`
- Marketing copy with communist puns

### The Value Proposition
"Understand how modern SSGs implement island architecture by reading <1500 lines of commented code. The communist theme makes it memorable. The architecture lessons are real."
